# On a fresh install, the install hook should set the port to the default
# value (or have already been set by the gadget snap), but if we're refreshing
# from a version which does not support a configurable port to one which does,
# the install hook does not run, so the configure hook would see the empty port
# setting and fail, reverting the refresh. To avoid this, ensure that after the
# refresh occurs, a port is set for the new revision so the configure hook
# triggered by the refresh will succeed as well.
