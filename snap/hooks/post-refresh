# On a fresh install, the install hook should set the port to the default
# value, but if we're refreshing from a version which does not support a
# configurable port to one which does, the install hook does not run, so the
# configure hook would see the empty port setting and fail, reverting the
# refresh. To avoid this, ensure that after the refresh occurs, a port is set
# for the new revision so the configure hook triggered by the refresh will
# succeed as well.
